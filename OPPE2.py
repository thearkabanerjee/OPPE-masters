# question statement


# Is Odd-Length Palindrome
# Write a function is_odd_length_palindrome that takes a string s and returns True if s is a palindrome of odd length, and False otherwise.

# NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

# Example

#     • "hello" --> False (not a palindrome)

#     • "noon" --> False (palindrome but not odd length)

#     • "nun" --> True (palindrome and odd length)
