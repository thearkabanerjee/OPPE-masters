# question statement:

# output1 = ... # int: sum of a and b
# output2 = ... # int: twice the sum of a and b
# output3 = ... # int: absolute difference between a and b
# output4 = ... # int: absolute difference between sum and product of a and b

# # Find discounted price given price and discount_percent
# # input variables : price: int, discount_percent: float
# discounted_price = ... # float

# # Round the discounted_price
# rounded_discounted_price = ... # int

# # Find hrs and mins given the total_mins
# # input variables : total_mins
# hrs = ... # int: hint: think about floor division operator
# mins = ... # int


# Sample inputs (# note: The values given in the prefix code(grey) will be changed by the autograder according to the testcase while running them.
a = 5
b = 6
price, discount_percent = 80, 5.75
total_mins = 470

output1 = (a+b)
output2 = 2 * (output1)
output3 = abs(a-b)
output4 = abs (output1 - (a*b))


## Find discounted price given price and discounted_percent

## input variables are : price: int, discount_percent: float


discounted_price = float((100- discount_percent) * price)
