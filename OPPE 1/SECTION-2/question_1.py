# Sum of Squares of Even Numbers
# Write a function sum_of_squares_of_even
# that takes a list of integers nums and returns
# the sum of squares of all even numbers in the list.

# >>> nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# >>> sum_of_squares_of_even(nums)
# 56
# NOTE: This is a function type question,
# you don't have to take input or print the output,
# just have to complete the required function definition.

# Explanation
# In the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
# the even numbers are 2, 4, and 6.
# The sum of their squares is 4 + 16 + 36 = 56.
