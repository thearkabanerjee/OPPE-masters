# question statement


# Remove elements at given two indices of a list
# Write a function remove_elements_at_two_indices that takes a list l and two indices i1 and i2. The function should remove the elements at these two indices from the list l.

# Assume the indices are non-negative and unique.

# The function should not return anything but should modify the input list directly.

# NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

# Example

# >>> l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
# >>> i1 = 5
# >>> i2 = 1
# >>> remove_elements_at_two_indices(l, i1, i2)
# >>> l
# [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
# Explanation
# The elements at indices 5 and 1 are 6 and 2, respectively. These elements are removed from the list l.
