# Arithmetic Operations tuple from two integers
# Given a tuple of two integers (a, b), return a tuple containing the sum, difference, product, and quotient (integer division) of the two numbers.
# Example:

# >>> arithmetic_operations((1, 2))
# (3, -1, 2, 0)

# def arithmetic_operations(t: tuple) -> tuple:
